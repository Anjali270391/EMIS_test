# EMIS_test 
Task:
An external system / supplier is sending patient data to our platform using the FHIR standard. Our analytics teams find this format difficult to work with when creating dashboards and visualizations. You are required to tranform these FHIR messages into a more workable format preferably in a tabular format. Include any documentation / commentary you deem necessary.
